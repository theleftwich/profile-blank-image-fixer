profile-blank-image-fixer
=========================

Finds profiles with no image and adds the standard blank image png to them.


*Important* You need the macro files from the Profile Updater and the Common macros to run this macro!


How to use this macro
----------------------

1. Make sure you have a local copy of the blank default png.

2. Edit add-blank-profile-image.js by specifying that local path. (The script is commented. The variables section is at the top.)
3. In iMacros, run add-blank-profile-image.js. 

4. Coffee break.
